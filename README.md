# MokeSell

MokeSell is a dynamic online platform designed to serve as a consumer-to-consumer (Peer-to-Peer) marketplace where users can conveniently buy and sell both new and second-hand items. It provides a smooth experience for individuals looking to trade goods within a trusted community.

By creating a single account, users gain access to a dual-purpose profile that allows them to both list items for sale and shop for the products they are looking for. MokeSellâ€™s intuitive design encourages engagement through features like profile "follows" and real-time chat.

MokeSell prioritizes user experience, trust, and transparency. Sellers can create detailed listings with photos, descriptions, and pricing, while buyers can easily browse or search for items by category or keyword.

## Design Process

We focused on understanding our target audience to create a seamless experience that meets their needs.

### User Stories

- **As a buyer**, I want to find things I need and/or like for a cheaper price. I would look up the item by the search bar or by category to find what I am looking for.
- **As a seller**, I want to sell my things for money. I would make a listing and if necessary, purchase a bump to boost it.

### Wireframes & Mockups
We have created wireframes and mockups to guide our design process. You can find these resources in the project directory or access them via the Adobe XD share link.

## Color Palette

We decided on this color palette because it blends warm and soft tones with a touch of elegance, creating a website that feels modern, creative, and welcoming.

- **Golden Mustard** - Adds a bright and energetic touch, making key elements stand out.
- **Soft Pink** - Provides a warm and calming feeling, making the site inviting.
- **Light Beige & Off-White** - Offers a clean and simple background, ensuring easy navigation and a visually appealing experience.

Overall, these colors create a natural and stylish look, ideal for a lifestyle-focused marketplace. They help draw attention to important sections while maintaining a sense of calmness.
